<p> <IMG ALIGN="CENTER"SRC=""> <FONT SIZE="6"><br><I>Hi! During the movement control order (MCO), I had an experience where I was my mom's representative for groceries at a supermarket near my home. At that time, people were not too numerous because only one family member was allowed to make the purchase. In addition, I must always be careful and follow the rules set by the goverment during the MCO. So, stay at home to break the COVID-19. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYm6HeDipWw">CLICK HERE</A>

<br>
There are several steps when buying groceries during the MCO: 
<ul>
	<li>  Make a list before going to the store to buy
	<li>  Make sure to wear a mask
	<li>  Make sure wear sanitizer in your hand
	<li>  Prioritize food items that can be stored for a long time
	<li>  Do not make 'panic buying'
	<li>  Obey the 1-meter social distance directions
</ul>

<p> <IMG ALIGN="CENTER"SRC=""> <FONT SIZE="6"><br><I>Next, I had an interesting experience where I filled my MCO time by doing a useful activities where I tried various cooking recipes and also made a viral drink during the MCO. 
One of the types of dishes I make is more to baking. There are caramel pudding, milo oreo pudding, tau fu fa and lastly it is a viral dalgona coffee. For me, it is easy to do all of this because the recipes are available on social media such as facebook and instagram. </I> </font size> </p>
